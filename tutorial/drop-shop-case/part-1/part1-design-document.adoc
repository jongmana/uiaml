This is the design document for the first version of the Drop Shop site.

=== Strategy Layer
The strategy layer will provide information about the Business Case and the Personas of the Drop Shop.

==== Business Case
The site to be build should provide some basic information for customers so that visitors of the site know what the shop is about, where to find it and when the shop is open for business. The shop owner also wants to distinguish himself from other sweets shop by showing that this shop really knows it's products.

==== Personas

* **Ilse**: A child of 11 years old who really likes all kinds of sweets especially when they are colorful.
* **Jaap**: A business man who often travels and always wants to have some 'drop' with him. He always is interested in new kinds of 'drop' and the story behind it.

=== Scope Layer
The scope layer describes the static and dynamic functionality of the site to be build, expressed by Use Cases and User Stories.

==== UML Use Cases
There are no UML Use Cases in this version of the Drop Shop.

==== User Stories

. As a customer I want to know where the shop is located and how it looks in order to determine if I want to travel to it.
. As a customer I want to know when the shop is open
. As a customer I want to see what kinds of sweets the shop provides.
. As the business owner I want to distinguish the shop from other sweets sellers by showing that the shop really is specialized in sweets and can provide information normally not available at other stores.

=== The Structure layer
In this chapter the model of the sitemap to be realised will be given.

This information about the location and opening hours is very important to him because he travels often by car and has to determine the route to the shop and if he will make it in time after work before the shop closes. 
!===
| Liquorice-Information | A story combined with some images about the liquorice plant and the history of sweets in general. 
This content area will be be the realization of the forth user story. |
[%autowidth, cols=3]
!===
! Ilse
! priority 1 
! For her this information is boring, only the image of the liquorice plant might get her attention.

! Jaap
! priority 5 
! For him this information is nice to know and might be useful in a conversation with foreigners who aren't familiar with this dutch treat. It also gives him some insurance that the store knows its sweets.
!===
| Assortment | A static overview of some sweets sold at the store (the third user story). |
[%autowidth, cols=3]

! Jaap
! priority 6
! It gives him a good impression of what the store has to offer, but he would prefer a more complete overview and online store.
