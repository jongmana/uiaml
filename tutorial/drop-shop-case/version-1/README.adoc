In this version a very simple first website for the fictional case "The Drop Shop" will be designed.

== The Strategy layer
Because we want to focus this tutorial on U__ia__ML we will not go very deep into how we approached this layer and the deliverables of this layer will be very summier.

=== Business Case
The site to be build should provide some basic information for customers so that visitors of the site know what the shop is about, where to find it and when the shop is open for business. The shop owner also wants to distingish himself from other sweets shop by showing that this shop really knows it's products.

=== Personas
The typical visitors of the shop and properly visitors of the site can be destingished between:

* **Ilse**: A child of 11 years old who really likes all kinds of sweets especially when they are colorful.
* **Jaap**: A business man who often travels and always wants to have some 'drop' with him. He always is interested in new kinds of 'drop' and the story behind it.

== The Scope layer
Because the site should be very basic the site will be static and will not provide any interactivity.
Therefore there are no UML Use Cases can be defined.
But from the Business Case we can extract some User Stories:

. As a customer I want to know where the shop is located and how it looks in order to determine if I want to travel to it.
. As a customer I want to know when the shop is open
. As a customer I want to see what kinds of sweets the shop provides.
. As the business owner I want to distingish the shop from other sweets sellers by showing that the shop really is specialized in sweets and can provide information normally not available at other stores.

== The Structure layer
We will now use the U__ia__ML Sitemap Diagram (SMD) to provide the sitemap deliverable of the structure layer.

We start this process of defining the SMD model by first determine the contentareas we want to use and their documentation.

.The Contentareas
image::./version1-structure1.png[The contentarea]

.Contentarea documentation
[%autowidth, options=header]
|===
| Contentarea ID | Description
| Shop-Information | Information about the location of the shop, some inside- and outside images of the store to give an impression of the store and a information about the opening hours.
This contentarea therefore fullfills the requirements of the first and second user story.
| Liquorice-Information | A story combined with some images about the liquorice plant and the history of sweets in general.
This content area will be be the realization of the forth user story.
| Assortment | A static overview of some sweets sold at the store (the third user story).
|===

By also using the extension 'ux-decision' we can determine the content priority for the contentareas.

! Based on the impressions of the store he determines whether to buy his sweets at the nearest supermarket or at this specialized store. This information about the location and opening hours is very important to him because he travels often by car and has to determine the route to the shop and if he will make it in time after work before the shop closes.

|===

From the table we can conclude that the 'Shop-Information' is most important to our personas followed by the 'Assortment' and that the 'Liquorice-Information' is less important. The 'Shop-Information' therefore should be on the first page the site visitors see.

Determining now our pages we decide to go with 3 pages, one for each of our contentareas and that the startpage should be the page containing the 'Shop-Information'. Which are all part of our 'Drop-Shop' Sitemap.

.First U__ia__ML sitemap
image::./version1-structure2.png[First sitemap]

The minimal documentation for this sitemap is given by the following tabel.

.page documentation
[options=header]
|===
| Page ID | Startpage | LandingPage
| Home-page | yes | no
| Product-info-page | no | no
| Assortment-page | no | no
|===

Since this tabel doesn't add information we already can see in the sitemap image itself we could argu that we can skip this tabel. But since their is currently no U__ia__ML CASE tool available, and these sitemaps are often drawn by hand, we add the tabel to make sure that we don't misinterpret a handdrawn sitemap. +
Another advantage of having this tabel is that we can extend it with for instance the ex-decision extension.

.page documentation with ux-decision extension
[%autowidth, cols="4*a"]
|===
| Page ID 
| Start +
page 
| Landing +
Page 
| ux-decision
| Home-page | yes | no |
[%autowidth, cols="3*"]
!===
! Ilse ! Shop-Information: __medium__ 
! There is only one contentarea on this page.
! Jaap ! Shop-Information: __medium__ 
! There is only one contentarea on this page.
!===

| Product-info-page | no | no |
[%autowidth, cols="3*"]
!===

! There is only one contentarea on this page.
! Jaap ! Liquorice-Information: __medium__ 
! There is only one contentarea on this page.

| Assortment-page | no | no |
[%autowidth, cols="3*"]
!===
! Ilse ! Assortment: __medium__ 
! There is only one contentarea on this page.
! Jaap ! Assortment: __medium__ 
! There is only one contentarea on this page.
!===
|===

However, since each page holds exactly one contentarea, their is no relative priority between the contentareas of the pages and therefore this tabel add's no meaningful information.

If we however would have decided to place the 'Shop-Information' and the 'Assortment' contentareas on the same page the relative priority between them would have mattered and the table then would provide some meaningful information that would be of value on the surface layer. Because a designer could then convert the priority by making the contentarea with the higher relative priority more visible prominent.

So far the sitemap fine, but it doesn't show any navigational links between the pages. This would mean that their is no navigation between them and the pages are only reachable by entering their URL in the browser.
We want to fix this and decide that a visitor should be able to access the Product-info-page as well as the Assortment-page from a link provided by the Shop-information contentarea.

NOTE: A link always starts from within a contentarea and points to page.

.U__ia__ML sitemap with links
image::./version1-structure3.png[sitemap with links]

Since the links we added are normal links triggered by the visitor of our site, no documentation of the links is required.

It also doesn't matter how many links from the Shop-Inforamtion contentarea toward for instance the Assortment-page the actually will be, they all are represented by a single link.

As can be seen from the sitemap the visitor will be able to navigate from the Shop-information contentarea of the default start page, the Home-page toward either the Product-info-page or the Assortment-page.
The Shop-information contentarea drawn within the Home-page therefore has become the contentarea that defines all the links of the Shop-information contentarea, which we indicate by underlining the ID of the contentarea.

We can also see that there are no links defined emmiting from the Liquorice-information contentarea as well as from the Assortment contentarea. 
But those are the only occurrences of those contentareas within our sitemap and therefore they are also automatically the contentareas the defines the links they are providing (none), which is why their contentarea ids too are underlined.

This means that a visitor who navigates away from the Home-page has to use the back button of the browser to navigate back to the Home-page. To solve this we could add links to the Assortment and Liquorice-Information contentarea but that is not what we want.
We want to add a menu to the pages in order to enable navigation between the pages.

We now could choose to add a menu to the description of each of the contentareas, but that is not a good choice. The menu is not something we would expect to be part of those contentareas. 

A better way is to add a new contentarea "Menu" that will be present on all pages, and will enable the visitors to naviate to all the pages of our site.

.Menu Contentarea documentation with ux-decision extension
[%autowidth, cols="3*a", options=header]

! The menu doesn't contain the content that she wants to see on the site, but it is a contentarea she expect to be part of the site.

! Jaap
! priority 4 
! The menu doesn't contain the content that he wants to see on the site, but it is a contentarea he expect to be part of the site.

.U__ia__ML the final sitemap
image::./version1-structure4.png[final sitemap]

If you take a closer look at the sitemap you will see that from the three Menu contentarea only one is underlined. As stated earlier, the one underlined defines all the links emmitting from that contentarea. Therefore each contentarea of the sitemap has exactly one link defining contentarea. +
The links defined at that contentarea are also available from the contentareas on the other pages. So on the Assortment-page for instance the menu contentarea also has three links going to the Home-page, the Product-info-page and one going to the Assortment-page itself.

One might further notice that the Menu contentarea on the Assortment-page isn't on the top like with the other pages and that the Menu-contentarea is just as big as the other contentarea on the page. This however doesn't matter from a modeling point of view. The Sitemap Diagram (SMD) is no wireframe and but an abstract model of the content, their distribution over the pages and the links between the contentareas and the pages.
A future extension with regard to the layout may adres this, but the layout is an aspect we currently don't model with U__ia__ML.


== The Skeleton layer

Now that we know which contentareas there will be, we can define them one by one, with the U__ia__ML Contentarea Diagram (CAD).

NOTE: The CAD is no wireframe but a blueprint meant for designers and developers that we can you to derive a wireframe. It's not a diagram that should be readable for customers.

=== The menu contentarea

To model the Menu contentarea we first need a Contentarea Diagram to hold the content of the menu contentarea.

.The Menu Contentarea construct
image::./version1-skeleton-menu1.png[The Menu contentarea construct]

Next we will define 3 text labels, one for each link that can be followed from the menu.

.The filled Menu Contentarea
image::./version1-skeleton-menu2.png[The filled Menu contentarea]

As stated by the specification of the cad-text-label we used, we also have to document these text labels.

.text label documentation
[%autowidth, cols="2*a", options=header]
|===
| Text label | Intended content
| Home | Text label to indicate that by activating this label the user will be navigated to the home page.
| Liquorice Information | Text label to indicate that by activating this label the user will navigate to the Liquorice Inforamtion page.
| Assortment | Text label to indicate that by activating this label the user will navigate to the Assortment page.
|===

To express that the labels are clickable and that they indeed activate a navigational link we have to add the links to them. +
The ID's of the links have to match those in the sitemap diagram.

.The Menu Contentarea with links
image::./version1-skeleton-menu3.png[The Menu contentarea with links]

And since this contentarea will also be present on all pages and a user might experience the menu as part of a site header, we can also include a clickable logo that will also result in a navigation toward the Home-page.

.The final Menu Contentarea
image::./version1-skeleton-menu4.png[The final Menu contentarea]

As with the text label elements the image element also requires documentation.

.image documentation
[%autowidth, cols="2*a", options=header]
|===
| Image ID | Intended content
| Logo | A company logo that by clicking will navigate the user to the home page.
|===

That there are now two links label 'Home', while the sitemap only shows one link has no consequences for either the sitemap diagram (SMD) or this contentarea diagram (CAD).

We could stop here and continue to the next contentarea, but we also have an option to apply the 'conent specification extension', which we will do here to give you an impression of this extension.

First we will determine whether the text labels are static or dynamically generated.

.text label documentation with content specification
[%autowidth, cols="3*a", options=header]
|===
| Text label | Intended content | type
| Home | Text label to indicate that by activating this label the user will be navigated to the home page. | static
| Liquorice Information | Text label to indicate that by activating this label the user will navigate to the Liquorice Inforamtion page. | static
| Assortment | Text label to indicate that by activating this label the user will navigate to the Assortment page. | static
|===

Next we will give the actual content for each text label for each language our shop site should support. Currently we our site will only support the Dutch language.

.text label documentation, content specification
[%autowidth, options="header"]
|===
| Text label | Language | Content
| Home | NL | "Home"
| Liquorice Information | NL | "Meer over drop"
| Assortment | NL | "Ons assortiment"
|===

Something we could also do for the image element

.image documentation with content specification extension
[%autowidth, cols="4*a", options=header]
|===
| Image ID | Intended content | type | URI
| Logo | A company logo that by clicking will navigate the user to the home page. | static | "D:\images\DropShopLogo.png"
|===

=== The Shop-Information contentarea

Since we have defined the intented content for this contentarea in the structure layer we now have an idea of the elements to be placed within this contentarea.

[quote]
Information about the location of the shop, some inside- and outside images of the store to give an impression of the store and a information about the opening hours.

We also want to welcome the visitors of the site which we combine with the impression images of the shop.
We therefore can destinguish three parts of this contentarea:

. Welcome & Impressions
. Opening hours
. Location information

It depends on whether those three parts should be seperatly reusable or that the user should expirence them as three seperate parts of the page.
If this is the case it might be a better choice to go back to the structure aspect of the site and model them as three seperate contentareas. For now however we will go on an model them on a single contentarea, the Shop-Information contentarea.

We start with the Welcome & Impression part, which we could model as a text labal of which its container contains two images in order to expres the grouping of this information.

.The Shop-Information Contentarea
image::./version1-skeleton-shop1.png[The Shop-Information contentarea]

To emphasize that the welcome text also needs a header we add an additional text label within the 'Welcome text' text label.

.The Shop-Information Contentarea
image::./version1-skeleton-shop2.png[The Shop-Information contentarea]

And since we can see in the sitemap that this contentarea should contain links toward the Liquorice information page and the Assortment page, which would make no sense at the Opening hours and / or Location part of this contentarea we add those links as well.

WARNING: But now we have a problem that we must deterministic determine from where those links are triggered. We therefore can not assign both links to a single content area element (CAE).

.The Shop-Information Contentarea
image::./version1-skeleton-shop3.png[The Shop-Information contentarea]

However because the 'Welcome header' and the images are within the text label of the welcome text, they will inherit the link provided by the Welcome text element if not overwritten as it is the case with the Inside Impression image element.
Again this isn't wat we wanted because a user might get confused that when he accidentally click on the welcome header get forwarded toward the Liquorice Information page.

To solve this we add additional text labels within the Welcome text that hold the links.

.The Shop-Information Contentarea
image::./version1-skeleton-shop4.png[The Shop-Information contentarea]

We can finish the page by adding the elements for the Opening hours and Location information.

.The Shop-Information Contentarea
image::./version1-skeleton-shop5.png[The Shop-Information contentarea]

NOTE: As with the Sitemap Diagram, the layout doesn't matter. A future extension with regard to the layout may adres this, but currently the layout is an aspect we don't model with U__ia__ML. The grouping however gives some visual layout gidelines, which for instance would be a layout violation if we would place the Outside Impression Image as part of the Location Information.

The last part we have to take care of before we can finish this contentarea is the documentation part of the elements.

.image documentation
[%autowidth, cols="2*a", options=header]
|===
| Image ID | Intended content 
| Outside Impression | An image that shows the shop from the outside, so that visitors can easily recognize the shop.
| Inside Impression | An image of the inside of the shop to give the impression that it's a nice clean shop, where the stocks are filled and their is plenty of sweets to choose from.
| Street Map | A simple street map that has a marker that shows the location of the shop.
|===

.text label documentation
[%autowidth, cols="2*a", options=header]
|===
| Text label | Intended content 
| Welcome header | A welcome slogan 
| Welcome text | A very short text about the shop that explains what this site is about, what the user can find here and why the user should shop here and not somewhere else.
| Liquorice information | part of the welcome text element that links to the Liquorice-Information-page.
| Assortment | part of the welcome text element that links to the Assortment-page.
| Opening hours | A table with the opening hours of the shop.
| Location information | The adres of the shop as well as information about the nearest public transport stop and about parking.

== Deliverables
Since this is a tutorial that contains many images and tables you might wonder what remains if you would write a design document.
In this chapter only the parts from this tutorial that would go into such a design document are extracted.

=== Strategy Layer

==== Business Case
The site to be build should provide some basic information for customers so that visitors of the site know what the shop is about, where to find it and when the shop is open for business. The shop owner also wants to distingish himself from other sweets shop by showing that this shop really knows it's products.

==== Personas

* **Ilse**: A child of 11 years old who really likes all kinds of sweets especially when they are colorful.
* **Jaap**: A business man who often travels and always wants to have some 'drop' with him. He always is interested in new kinds of 'drop' and the story behind it.

=== Scope Layer

==== User Stories

. As a customer I want to know where the shop is located and how it looks in order to determine if I want to travel to it.
. As a customer I want to know when the shop is open
. As a customer I want to see what kinds of sweets the shop provides.
. As the business owner I want to distingish the shop from other sweets sellers by showing that the shop really is specialized in sweets and can provide information normally not available at other stores.
