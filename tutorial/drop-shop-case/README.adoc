The case used in this tutorial is based on a fictional store, called the 'Drop Shop'.

"Drop" is the dutch word for liqurorice, and is one of the most favorite sweets of the Dutch which therefore comes in lots of varieties.
"The Drop Shop" is a fictional sweets store that is specialized in 'drop'. +
In this case the shop owner wants a website to promote his shop and offers an online webshop. But because it's a very small shop with little financial funding for a site, we will start with a very simple static site. An from there we will iterate toward the final goal, the  online shop site.
