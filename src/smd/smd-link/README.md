## Explanation
Links are the key elements of a sitemap. They provide navigational paths between the different sitemap elements (SME). There are however some restrictions to a link:

* A normal “clickable” link starts within a [contentarea](../smd-contentarea/README.md) that holds a Contentarea Element (CAE) by which a user can trigger the link and points toward the [page](../smd-page/README.md) that will be shown next.

* Event links are generated by either the result of a Decision Node (see: SMD - Decision Node), a system trigger like a timer or by a user generated system trigger generated outside of the sitemap like clicking on the close window button.
In case of a system trigger the documentation requires that the trigger will be described.
The starting point of an event link is either a [contentarea](../smd-contentarea/README.md), a Decision Node (see: Decision Node) or the frame of the [sitemap](../smd-sitemap/README.md).
