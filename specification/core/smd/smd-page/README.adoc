== Explanation
A Page is the container of a number of contentareas (see: link:../smd-contentarea/README.adoc[SMD - Contentarea Element] ). The page container can hold any number of content areas.
A Page is not a physical representation of a file, like default.html or article.php. In U__ia__ML a Page represents what the user experience as a page.
