== Explanation
Links are the key elements of a link:../smd-sitemap/README.adoc[sitemap]. They provide navigational paths between the different sitemap elements (SME). There are however some restrictions to a link:

* A normal “clickable” link starts within a link:../smd-contentarea/README.adoc[contentarea] that holds a Contentarea Element (CAE) by which a user can trigger the link and points toward the link:../smd-page/README.adoc[page] that will be shown next.

* Event links are generated by either the result of a link:../smd-decision-node/README.adoc[Decision Node], a system trigger like a timer or by a user generated system trigger generated outside of the link:../smd-sitemap/README.adoc[sitemap] like clicking on the close window button.
In case of a system trigger the documentation requires that the trigger will be described.
The starting point of an event link is either a link:../smd-contentarea/README.adoc[contentarea], a link:../smd-decision-node/README.adoc[Decision Node] or the frame of the link:../smd-sitemap/README.adoc[sitemap].
