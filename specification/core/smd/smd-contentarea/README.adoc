== Explanation
A contentarea is the container that hold several contentarea elements (CAE), like text, images or input fields. There are no hard rules about the boundaries of a contentarea, but often a deployed contentarea is recognizable by a different background or a frame that groups the content.

A contentarea might reappear on several different pages within a single site. The menu is an example of such a contentarea.
Within a U__ia__ML Sitemap there is for each contentarea with the same contentarea Id exactly one contentarea symbol in which the contentarea Id is underlined. This is the defining contentarea. Only from that link:../smd-link/README.adoc[contentarea] to other link:../smd-page/README.adoc[pages] may be drawn.
